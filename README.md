# Student Performance Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict student performance based on various academic and socio-economic factors.

## Project Structure

- **`Data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`EDA.ipynb`**: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook to understand data patterns.
- **`mian.ipynb`**: Main notebook for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all necessary Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmeddelattarr/-StudentPerformance.git
   cd -StudentPerformance
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks**:
   - Start with `EDA.ipynb` to explore the dataset.
   - Proceed to `mian.ipynb` for model training and evaluation.
